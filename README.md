# mpl-third-party

List of matplotlib user-contributed packages.  These are served at http://matplotlib.org/mpl-third-party/.

To add your package to the list, create a YAML file `your-cool-mpl-package.yml` with the following fields:

```yml
repo: matplotlib/cmocean
section: colormaps
description: Perceptually uniform colormaps for commonly-used oceanographic variables
site: # optional, default repo site
keywords:  # optional,
pypi_name:  # optional, default repo name
conda_package:  # optional
conda_channel:  # optional, default conda-forge
```
Either fork this repo and add the new file to the `packages` directory,
or use the `Add File` button above. Then open a pull request with the new file.

Note: The name of the yml file and the name of the repo should ideally match.

The `section` entry should be one of the sections listed in <./section_names.yml>.

## Development

The list of yml files in `packages/` is parsed by `python/build.py` using `template.rst` and
the result is saved to `docs/source/packages.rst`.  This script is called by `docs/Makefile`
using `make html`.  This runs a `sphinx-build` and makes the page at `build/html/index.html`.

This was heavily based on the nice work at <https://pyviz.org>.
