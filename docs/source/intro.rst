A list of packages that extend Matplotlib.  These are maintained 
and distributed independently from Matplotlib so go to the website 
listed for instructions.  

Please contribute your package by opening a pull-request at 
https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-third-party using the template in the
`readme <https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-third-party>`_

If you need help making a package, see 
https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib-extension-cookiecutter
where we give you a template to make it easy!

You can find more packages at 
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Framework+%3A%3A+Matplotlib>`_ 
if package maintainers have added the ``Framework :: Matplotlib`` 
in the classifier list in the ``setup.py`` file of their package.
